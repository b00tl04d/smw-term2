## Defining Certificate Requirements  
Microsoft Win Server enables secure data access based on the use of <b>digital certificates</b>  

Certificates allow users or systems to prove to others that they aare who they say they are  

Before you can use digital certificates, you need to design a <b>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</b>
