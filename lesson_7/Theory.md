## Defining Certificate Requirements  
Microsoft Win Server enables secure data access based on the use of <b>digital certificates</b>  

Certificates allow users or systems to prove to others that they are who they say they are  

Before you can use digital certificates, you need to design a <b>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</b>  

<br>

<b>To protect exchanging Messages from eavesdropping attack with Asynchronous Encryption Algorithm<b>
* A key-pair is associated with an individual party
* Each individual party will keep its private key as a secret but share out its public key to everyone
* Messages beng encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key
* A digital signed message with the individual private key can only be verified by its corresponding public key

<br>

<b>There is one problem</b>
* How can we obtain a genuine public key of a particular party before we can establish a secure communication channel with the party?

<br>

<b>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</b>
* Refers to tech that includes a series of features relating to authentication and encryption
* Based on a system of certificates, each cert contains a public key and the name of the subject
* Allows an org to publish, use, renew, and/or revoke certs and enroll clients

<br>

### What is a digital cert?  

Vid [src](generally_glad_grubworm_LmcLZhFf) (watch from 14:21 and onwards)  

Why do we need it?  
To hold a trustworthy public key, this key will be used for subsequent secure communication between the cert recipient and the owner of the public key, the owner of the public key is the one who knows the corresponding private key  

<br>

How to tell if a digital cert is genuine?  
We need to have Root CA and its subsidary Issuer CAs which will be responsible for signing on the digital cert  
If we receive a digital certificate and we can verified it is signed by a trustworthy Root CA (or its subsidiaries) , we will trust the certificate as well as the content , that is the public key  

<br>

Certificates may be required for the following apps
* Digital signatures
* Secured e-mail
* <b>Secured HTTP communication (HTTPS/SSL)</b>
* Internet authentication
* <b>Software code signing</b>
* IP security
* Smart card logon
* Encrypted file system
* <b>802.1x authentication</b>

<br>

### Certificate Authority (CA)  

A Certificate Authority (CA) is an entity that issues digital certs to other parties  

The Root CA can issue certs to subordinate or intermediate or issuing CAs  

Issuing CAs can issue certs to users or clients  

<br>

### Certificate Authority Hierarchies and Roles  

Types of hierarchies that can be used for CAs  
* Rooted trust model  
* Cross-certification trust model  
* Hybrid trust model  

<br>

Roles that can be chosen for CAs include  
* For standalone CA, Rudimentary CA, and Intermediate CA  
* For Enterprise CA, Basic-security CA, Medium-security CA, and High-security CA  

<br>

### Rooted Trust Model    

A model in which the root CA has a self-signed cert, and the CA issues a cert to all direct subordinate CAs  

CAs in this model can be online or offline; allows flexibility in deploying and managing PKI  

Each CA serves a single role within the hierarchy and is not dependent on other CAs; allows rooted trust hierarchies to be more scalable and easier to administer than other hierarchies  

Possible to add a new CA to a hierarchy  

Rooted trust hierarchies fall into 2 subcategories: two-tier CA hierarchy and three-tier CA hierarchy  

Any CA in a rooted trust hierarchy is either a root or a subordinate but never both  

Each CA is responsible for processing requests, issuing certs, revoking certs, and publishing CRLs  

Each CA can be managed independently  

Diagram illustration  
![image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020230815151717.png)  

Shows the Root CA is supposed to be trusted by everyone  

It will sign a few certs to empower a couple of servers to become intermediate CAs  

These few intermediate CAs will then empower the next level of CAs  

At the lowest level, these servers will be operational servers which issue out digital certs to clients which ask for services  

Note that the top level CA in the Rooted Trust Model is always based on a self-signed cert to distribute out its public key, everyone will unconditionally trust this self-signed cert and the public key it holds  

<br>

### Cross-Certificates Model  

A model in which all CAs are self-signed and trust relationships between CAs are based on cross-certitficates, certs issued by 1 CA will be trusted by PCs which belong to other CA hierarchy (cross hierarchy trust)  

Cross-certs does not need to be bidirectional  

Advantages: Low cost and greater flexibility  

Disadvantages: Greater administrative overhead and increase risk of unauthorized access to internal resources

### Using Third-Party CAs  

Useful when an org conducts most of its business with external customers and clients  

Examples of 3rd-party CAs: DigiCert, GlobalSign or GoDaddy  

<br>

Advantages
* Customers have greater degree of confidence when conducting secure transactions with organisations because they trust the third party CA  
* Allows an organization to take advantage of third party CAâ€™s understanding of technical, legal, and business issues with certificate use  

<br>

Disadvantages  
* High per-cert cost  
* Allows less flexibility in managing certs  
* Autoenrollment is not possible  

<br>

Windows system already configured with a list of trusted commercial 3rd-party CAs, which can easily be viewed and configured via web browser  

<br>

### Installing CA Roles  

Root CA is installed first, followed by installing intermediate CAs, and finally the issuing CAs  

Root CA is at the top of a certification hierarchy and must be trusted unconditionally by clients in an org
* An enterprise root CA stores its info in Active Directory and the server that hosts the service must be joined to the domain  
* Storing the root CA offline is much more secure  

<br>

Intermediate CA is a subordinate to a root CA  

Issuing CA issues certs to users and PCs

<br>

## Selecting a Certificate Enrollment and Renewal Method  

Depends on
* Types of certs you intend to use  
* Number and type of clients that you enroll  

<br>

Two types
* Manual, if administrative approval is required; most useful for issuing and renewing PC and IPsec certs  
* Automatic, if no approval is needed; can improve administrative control over certs  

<br>

Methods for automatic enrollment
* Cert autoenrollment and renewal based on a combination of Group Policy settings and cert templates  
* Certificate Request Wizard and Cert Renewal Wizard  
* Web enrollment support pages  
* Smart card enrollment station  

<br>

### Obtaining cert from an issuing CA  

Cert Services Web page (Windows CA comes with a Web interface that lets users request for cert enrolment, also allows users to download the root CA cert and its cert chain)  
After downloaded the certificate chain, the user may install it into the system's  Trusted Root Certificate Authority Repository  
![image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020230815153658.png)  

<br>

### Configuring Cert Templates  

Cert services provides cert templates to simplify the process of requesting and issuing certs  

Each template contains the rules and settings; can serve a single purpose or multiple purposes  

Diagram of commonly used Cert Templates  
![image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020230815153957.png)  

<br>

Cert templates are available only on Enterprise Root and subordinate CAs  

Stored in Active Directory  

Available to every enterprise CA in the forest  

<br>

Cert Templates MMC snap-in provides admins with the capability to  
* Create additional templates by duplicating and modifying existing templates  
* Modify template properties  
* Configure policies applied to cert enrollment, issuance, and application  
* Allow the autoenrollment of certs  
* Configure ACLs on cert templates  

<br>

Issuance of cert requests can be controlled in 3 ways
* Configuring permissions on the template from the security tab  
* Preventing the CA from issuing that cert type by deleting the template  
* Configuring the permissions on the CA  

<br>

Restrict permissions on your CAs to prevent unauthorized access  

Configure the discretionary access control list (DACL) for each template  

<br>

### Configuring Archival and Recovery of Keys  

Possible to configure the CA to archive private keys of certs at the time of issuance; enables to recover the key should it be lost  

Only highly trusted individuals should be granted the privilege of arching and recovering keys  

Cert Services does not archive private keys by default  

Key recovery methods: key recovery agent, certutil tool, and krt.exe  

Slide notes
Here is the time we need to explain another important aspect of the PKI operations. 
Thatâ€™s, the generation of the key-pair.  

There are two approaches.  
One is the certificate owner (and the requester) whom will first create a key-pair and send the public key to the CA to ask its service.  
To enclose the public key into a digital certificate with the CAâ€™s digital signature.  In this approach, the CA has no knowledge of  the owner's private key.  

The other is, the certificate owner will just ask for a comprehensive service from the CA, to help generate the key pair and seal the public key in a digital certificate. The requester will be able to get  back the private key of the key pair, and the digital certificate that holds the public key. In this case, the requester has to trust the CA , which will delete the private key from the CAâ€™s system.  

In the second approach, it will give the CA an option to archive the private key, as described in the slide.  

<br>

### Deploying and Revoking Cert for users, PCs, and CAs  

Possible to automate the deployment of certs by configuring Group Policy  

<br>

Manual approval should be required for  
* All certs that are needed to perform network admin tasks or software development  
* All certs issued to joint venture partners  

<br>

Conditions to auto-enroll certs
* Client PC must be integrated into Active Directory  
* Users require the Read, Enroll, and Autoenroll permissions  

<br>

Reasons for revoking a cert
* Cert is compromised  
* Termination of the account to whom the cert was issued  

The life span of a digital certificate is by default limited by its expiry date setting. However, in cases, we may need to invalidate a digital certificate before it reaches its expiry date.  

<br>

Diagram of revoking a cert  
![image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020230815154941.png)  

This slide shows how the CA administrator can revoke an issued certificate.  However, since PKI is based on a trusted model which does not require always online validation. 
Even a certificate has been revoked by the CA, other systems  may not be aware of such revocation.  That is why we need the Certificate Revocation List.  

<br>

### Certification Revocation Lists (CRLs)  

All certs have specified lifetimes  

In some situations, there is need to invalidate or <b>revoke</b> a cert before it has reached the end of its lifetime  

Revoked certs are published in the cert revocation list (CRL)  

CRLs are valid only for a limited time, PKI clients need to retrieve a new CRL periodically  

Must define the CRL location along with the access path before deploying certs  

<br>

### OCSP and OCSP Responder

OCSP  
* Online Certificate Status Protocol, RFC 6960, proposed in 2013  
* An internet protocol used for obtaining the revocation status of an X.509 digital cert  
* It complements (not replace) the operations of CRLs  

<br>

OCSP Responder  
* A server typically run by the cert issuer which returns a signed response on the status of a particular issued cert  
* Possible responses are Good, Revoked, Unknown, or No response as the issuer does not implement the responder service (could also be because the query itself has a problem, i.e. signature of the cert is not signed properly)  

<br>

Comparison to CRLs
* Less burden for clients to maintain CRLs (network and storage)
* Easier to implement compared to CRLs for up to date checking  
* OCSP uses non-encrypted messages, it may be subjected to interception  
* OCSP is an optional component for the cert server
