## IPsec Security Issues and Concepts  

### IPsec Concepts  

IPsec is a set of protocols used to ensure private, secure communications over IP networks by using cryptographic security services based on

* Protecting the contents of IP packets
* Providing packet filtering
* Enforcing trusted communication
* Securing communication with encryption of the info traveling the network
* Mostly used as an option for IPv4 implementations
